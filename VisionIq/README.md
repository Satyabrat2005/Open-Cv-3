### Ask Your Video Anything

> IQryx is a local-first video intelligence engine that converts raw video into searchable, explainable, evidence-grounded knowledge.

IQryx does not guess.  
IQryx does not hallucinate.  
IQryx **observes, remembers, and retrieves truth from video**.

This is not object detection.  
This is not captioning.  
This is **video intelligence infrastructure**.

---

##  What Is VisionIQ?

Video is everywhere — security cameras, meetings, factories, hospitals, research labs.  
Yet video remains the **least intelligent and least usable form of data**.

IQryx fixes that.

It transforms raw video into a **persistent semantic memory** that you can query using natural language.

Upload a video.  
IQryx watches it frame by frame.  
Ask a question.  
IQryx retrieves the exact visual evidence that answers it.

---

##  What Can You Ask?

- Where is the bottle in the video?
- When does the laptop first appear?
- What happens before the bottle becomes visible?
- Show scenes with both a backpack and a laptop.
- Which objects appear throughout the video?

IQryx answers using **what the video actually shows** — not assumptions, not guesses.

---

##  Why IQryx Exists

Most AI systems treat video as:
- static frames
- autogenerated captions
- black-box summaries

IQryx treats video as **experience over time**.

It combines:
- Vision
- Semantics
- Memory
- Retrieval

The result is **searchable, explainable, and auditable video understanding**.

## Core Capabilities (V1)

### Video Understanding
- Frame-by-frame video processing
- Temporal awareness (before / after / during)
- Object-level perception
- Optimized for DeepSeek-R1 integration

### Semantic Search
- Text-to-frame similarity search
- Robust to partial visibility
- Ranked, deterministic retrieval

### Intelligent Memory
- Vector-based storage using FAISS
- Persistent frame-level indexing
- Reusable intelligence (process once, query forever)

### Privacy First
- Fully local execution
- No cloud dependency
- Safe for sensitive and private videos

---

##  Advanced Capabilities (Planned)

- LLM-based reasoning over retrieved evidence
- Natural language answers with traceable explanations
- Multi-object logical queries (AND / OR)
- Cross-video semantic search
- Timeline-aware reasoning

The LLM never sees raw video.  
It reasons only over **filtered, retrieved evidence**.

##  Hardware Requirements

Recommended minimum:

- GPU: RTX 3060 / 4060 (8GB VRAM)
- RAM: 16 GB
- Storage: 20 GB+
- OS: Windows or Linux

Scales cleanly with better hardware.

---

##  Installation

Create virtual environment:

py -3.10 -m venv vision-iq-env

Activate environment (Windows):

.\IQryx-env\Scripts\Activate.ps1

Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

---

##  Basic Query Engine (V1)

VisionIQ already supports **semantic video querying without any LLM**.

This baseline engine:
- embeds video frames
- stores them in vector memory
- retrieves relevant frames for text queries

Pure vision. Pure semantics. Zero hallucination.

---

##  Run the Query Engine

cd src
python test_query_engine.py

### Example Query

>> where is bottle

### Output (LLM-Free, Evidence-Only)

 VisionIQ Query (type 'exit' to quit)

##  VisionIQ Philosophy

AI should not just generate text.  
It should **understand reality**.

IQryx is built on the principle that:
- intelligence must be grounded
- memory must be persistent
- reasoning must be auditable

##  About NeuroTitan

IQryx is developed under **NeuroTitan AI Labs**, a research-driven initiative focused on:

- Applied AI systems
- Cognitive infrastructure
- Local-first intelligence
- AI–semiconductor co-design

IQryx is not a demo.  
It is not a chatbot.  
It is not a toy.

It is **infrastructure for intelligent video systems**.

If you believe video should be **searchable, explainable, and trustworthy** —  
you’re in the right place.
