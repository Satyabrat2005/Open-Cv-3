## 🚀 Overview

**Open-CV-3** is a personal computer vision workspace where I consolidate and evolve my OpenCV-based projects. The goal of this repository is not just to demonstrate OpenCV usage, but to push toward **practical, intelligent, and interactive vision systems**.

This repo currently contains:

* 🖐️ **Cursor Control using Hand Gestures**
* 👁️ **VisionIQ – A modular computer vision experimentation framework**

More projects will be continuously added as this repository grows.

## 🖱️ Project 1: Cursor Control using Hand Gestures

### 🔍 Description

This project implements **real-time cursor control using hand gestures**, leveraging computer vision and hand landmark detection.

The system captures live video from the webcam, detects hand landmarks, interprets gestures, and maps them to cursor actions such as:

* Cursor movement
* Left click
* Right click
* Scroll

This project demonstrates how **human–computer interaction (HCI)** can be reimagined using vision-based input systems.

### 🧠 Core Concepts Used

* OpenCV (Video capture & preprocessing)
* Hand landmark detection (MediaPipe / custom logic)
* Gesture classification
* Screen coordinate mapping
* Real-time performance optimization

### ✨ Features

* Smooth cursor tracking
* Gesture-based clicking
* Minimal latency
* Works with standard webcams

## 👁️ Project 2: VisionIQ

### 🔍 Description

**VisionIQ** is a modular computer vision experimentation framework designed for rapid prototyping and testing of vision ideas.

It acts as a sandbox where multiple CV pipelines can coexist, such as:

* Object detection
* Motion tracking
* Face analysis
* Image transformations
* Feature extraction

VisionIQ focuses on **clean architecture**, **extensibility**, and **research-first development**.

### 🧠 Core Concepts Used

* OpenCV pipelines
* Modular CV architecture
* Experiment-driven design
* Performance benchmarking

### ✨ Features

* Plug-and-play vision pipelines
* Easy experimentation
* Scalable project structure
* Research-friendly setup

## 🧪 Philosophy

> *Computer vision should not be locked behind theory alone.*
> *It should be interactive, experimental, and grounded in real-world use cases.*

Open-CV-3 is built with this mindset — learning by building, testing by experimenting.
