# 🧠 OpenCV-3

Welcome to **OpenCV-3** — a personal collection of my OpenCV projects, experiments, and mini-tutorials!  
This repo will grow over time as I explore new computer vision concepts, algorithms, and real-world applications.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This repository is a **hub of OpenCV projects**, ranging from simple image-processing scripts to more advanced applications like:
- Face & object detection
- Image transformations & filters
- Motion tracking
- Edge detection & contour analysis
- And much more...

Each project is self-contained, well-documented, and easy to run or modify.

---


Each folder represents a single project or experiment.  
You’ll find a short description and usage guide inside each project’s own `README.md`.
