Welcome to the OpenCV Virtual Painting project! This repository showcases a computer vision-based virtual drawing application that allows users to draw on a screen using hand gestures. 
The project utilizes OpenCV and Mediapipe for real-time hand detection and tracking.

In this project, we use hand gestures to control a virtual paintbrush. By detecting finger movement through the webcam, the program allows you to paint on a virtual canvas, change colors, and even erase using simple hand gestures. The project aims to provide a fun and intuitive way to interact with technology without the need for any physical tools!

Key Features:
Real-time hand tracking using OpenCV and Mediapipe.
Color selection: Users can change colors dynamically.
Drawing mode: Paint on a virtual canvas with different brush sizes.
Eraser mode: Switch to an eraser to remove unwanted lines.
Smooth drawing experience with fluid and responsive strokes.

How It Works
The system works by:

Using a webcam to capture real-time video feed.
Detecting hand landmarks (especially fingers) using Mediapipe.
Tracking finger movements to control the virtual paintbrush on the screen.
Offering a simple color palette on the video feed, allowing users to select colors by hovering over them with their index finger.
